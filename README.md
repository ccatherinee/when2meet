Key distinguishing features identified/implemented: 
Unlike in Doodle, where users are given a set of possible times and asked to click "yes", "no" or "maybe" for each of those times, When2Meet adopts a more visual interface in which users "paint" their availability onto the calendar by painting the times the user is available. Note that the user can paint or unpaint by simply dragging over the desired areas.
